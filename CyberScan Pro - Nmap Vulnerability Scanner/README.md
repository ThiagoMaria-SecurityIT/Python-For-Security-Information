# AI for Cybersecurity Demo - Under Development  

# CyberScan Pro - Nmap Vulnerability Scanner

![CyberScan Pro Screenshot](screenshot.png)     

## Transparency  
- üìÖ Repository created: July 20, 2025    
- This project was created with the assistance of DeepSeek's AI model   
- Code was reviewed and refined by human developers to ensure:
   - Security best practices  
   - Functional correctness  
   - Production readiness

## Why This Matters
I believe in transparent AI-human collaboration. While AI accelerates development, human expertise ensures:  
‚úÖ Real-world applicability  
‚úÖ Ethical considerations  
‚úÖ Compliance with security standards   
 
## Overview

CyberScan Pro is an advanced network vulnerability scanner with a modern dark UI, designed for cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and IT teams. It leverages Nmap's powerful scanning capabilities while providing an intuitive graphical interface for vulnerability assessment.

**Key Purpose**:  
Automate network security audits by identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities across your infrastructure with enterprise-grade reporting.

## Features

- üéØ **Automatic Network Detection**: Smart local network discovery
- üîç **Comprehensive Scanning**: Port, service, OS, and vulnerability detection
- üìä **Interactive Results**: Three-tab view (Summary, Vulnerabilities, Hosts)
- üìÅ **Multi-Format Reporting**: Export to HTML, JSON, or text
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Parallel scanning and timeout controls
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**: Confirmation prompts for large scans

## Target Audience

1. **Security Teams**: Regular network vulnerability assessments
2. **SysAdmins**: Infrastructure hardening and compliance checks
3. **Penetration Testers**: Initial reconnaissance phase
4. **IT Managers**: Visual security status reporting

## Installation

```
Clone this folder or download the files
```


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8+
- Nmap installed on system
- Administrator/root privileges for full scanning

## Usage

### Basic Scanning
1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python nmap-vulnerability-scanner.py
   ```
2. Click **"Scan My Network"** for automatic local network detection
   - *or*  
   Enter specific target (IP/CIDR) manually
3. Select scan profile (Quick/Full/Vulnerability)
4. Click **"Start Scan"**

### Exploring Results
- **Summary Tab**: Overview of scan statistics
- **Vulnerabilities Tab**:  
  - Color-coded by severity (High/Medium/Low)
  - Sort by clicking column headers
- **Hosts Tab**:  
  - Left panel: List of discovered hosts
  - Click any host to view details in right panel

### Exporting Reports
1. After scanning, click **"Export Report"**
2. Choose format:
   - **HTML**: Visual report with color coding
   - **JSON**: Machine-readable raw data
   - **TXT**: Simple text format
3. Select destination and save

## Configuration

Edit `config.yml` to customize:
```yaml
scan:
  ports: "1-10000"  # Port range
  timing: 4         # Aggressiveness (0-5)
scripts:
  enable: true      # Vulnerability scripts
```

## Best Practices

1. Start with **Quick Scan** profile for initial assessment
2. Use **Vulnerability Scan** for in-depth security checks
3. For large networks:
   - Scan during off-peak hours
   - Use /24 subnets instead of larger ranges
4. Always verify results before taking action
